            <p class="house4-description">

                Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. Its emblematic animal is
                the serpent, and its colors are green and silver.Slytherin values ambition, cunning, leadership, and
                resourcefulness. Slytherins have highly developed senses of self-preservation. Slytherins tend to take
                charge and possess strong leadership skills. Slytherins are often self-assured and confident of their
                own
                competence and can be very loyal. Another characteristic some Slytherins share is a tendency towards
                deep,
                unrequited love.

                The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent. The house colours are green and silver. The Head of House
                is
                Severus Snape. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody Baron. The Slytherin dormitories and common
                room
                are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The
                Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green
                lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described have a greenish glow. Slytherin corresponds roughly
                with
                the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western
                European
                mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.

                The founder of this house is Salazar Slytherin. He was a pure-blood wizard, noted for his cunning and
                determination. Slytherin built the Chamber of Secrets and left there his Basilisk behind. Salazar
                Slytherin
                was one of the earliest recorded Parselmouths and used this ability to control a Basilisk. He also was a
                Parselmouth - person who can speak language of serpents. Slytherin owned a wand made of Snakewood with a
                Basilisk horn core. It was passed down through the generation until it was stolen from Gormlaith Gaunt
                by
                her niece Isolt Sayre and later buried on the grounds of Ilvermorny School in North America.</p>
