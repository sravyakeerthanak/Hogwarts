            <h2>RAVENCLAW</h2>
            <p class="house4-description">

                Ravenclaw values intelligence, creativity, learning, and wit. Its emblematic animal
                is the eagle, and its colors are blue and silver.Ravenclaw values intelligence, creativity, learning,
                and
                wit. The house mascot is an eagle. The house colours are blue and bronze. The Head of this house is the
                Charms professor, Filius Flitwick. The house ghost is The Grey Lady.

                The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, on the west side of Hogwarts. The common room, which went
                undescribed in the series until the climax of Deathly Hallows, is round and filled with blue hangings
                and
                armchairs, has a domed ceiling painted with stars and features a replica statue of Rowena wearing her
                diadem. Harry also notes that Ravenclaws "have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains". A
                logical
                riddle must be solved to gain entry, whereas the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms only require a
                password (Hufflepuffs need to tap a barrel in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff"), indicating that it may
                be
                easier for those students from other houses who possess a high degree of intelligence to enter this
                common
                room than others. Professor McGonagall, the head of the Gryffindor House, solves the riddle accurately.

                The founder of this house is Rowena Ravenclaw. Noted for her intelligence and creativity and regarded as
                one
                of the greatest witches of the age. It is a popular historical theory that the location and name of
                Hogwarts
                were both chosen by Ravenclaw, who dreamt that a warty hog was leading her to a cliff by the lake.
                Ravenclaw
                came up with the ever-changing floor plan. Ravenclaw died sometime in the eleventh century, after she
                fell
                fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart is the cause â€” because her daughter Helena ran away with
                her
                diadem.</p>
