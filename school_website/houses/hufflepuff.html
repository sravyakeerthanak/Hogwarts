                Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play. Its emblematic animal is the badger, and
                its colors are yellow and black.Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice,
                and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger. Hufflepuff's calours are yellow and black. The Head of this
                house is the Herbology teacher Pomona Sprout. The house ghost is The Fat Friar.
                The entrance to the Hufflepuff dormitories and common room entrance is concealed in a pile of large
                barrels
                in an alcove in the corridor that holds the kitchen.

                To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom
                in the middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff". Unlike any other house, the
                Hufflepuff
                common room has a repelling device that douses the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped
                or
                the rhythm is wrong. The Hufflepuff common room is filled with yellow hangings and fat armchairs and it
                has
                little underground tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like
                barrel
                tops.

                The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff. She was born in the 10th Century and came from the broad
                valleys of Wales. She was very tolerant. While the other founders chose to have special students,
                Hufflepuff
                accepted them all. Helga Hufflepuff had a gift for Food-related charms, and her recipes are still used
                as
                the basis for many Hogwarts feasts. Helga Hufflepuff also arranged for the house-elf contingent to work
                in
                the kitchens, giving them somewhere safe to work, where they would not be mistreated or abused.</p>
