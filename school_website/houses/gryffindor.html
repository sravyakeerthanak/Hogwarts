            <h2>GRYFFINDOR</h2>
            <p class="house1-description">

                Gryffindor values bravery, courage, and chivalry. Its emblematic animal is thelion, and its colors are
                red and gold.
                Gryffindor values courage, bravery, nerve, and chivalry. Gryffindor's mascot is the lion. Gryffindor's
                colours are
                scarlet and gold. The Head of this house is the Transfigurationteacher and Deputy Headmistress Minerva
                McGonagall.
                The house ghost is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, more commonly known as Nearly Headless Nick.

                The Gryffindor dormitories and common room is in one of the castle's highest towers, and its entrance is
                on the
                seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a painting of The Fat Lady, who is garbed
                in a pink
                dress.She permits entry only after being given the correct password. Behind her painting is a large
                common room,
                with a fireplace,and two staircases leading up to the girls' and boys' dormitories.


                There is a spell on the girls' staircase that prevents boys from using it; however, there is no such
                enchantment on
                the staircase to the boys' dormitory, allowing girls to use it whenever they wish, for the founders'
                belief that
                girls were more trustworthy. The common room is very comfortable, and members of the Gryffindor house
                meet there for
                study groups, celebrations, or relaxation. The walls are lined with portraits, depicting current Head of
                Gryffindor.

                The founder of the house is Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor hailed from a moor which is now known as
                Godric's
                Hollow, a small West Country village in England. Godric Gryffindor was said to be the greatest duellist
                of
                his time. He also possessed skill at Muggle duelling, using his sword in combat. He, with the help of
                the
                other founders, transfigured the Sorting Hat into a sentient artefact to sort students after his
                lifetime.
